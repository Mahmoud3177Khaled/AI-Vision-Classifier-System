# 🤖 AI-Vision-Classifier-System

## Automated Material Stream Identification (MSI)

An end-to-end computer vision system for **real-time material classification** using deep feature extraction and classical machine learning classifiers.  
The system is designed to be robust to real-world variations such as lighting changes, motion blur, and sensor noise.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Vision-Classifier-System** identifies materials from images or live webcam streams using:

- CNN-based feature extraction (**ResNet50**)
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** as the primary classifier
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** as a baseline model
- **Unknown class detection** using probability thresholding
- **Real-time deployment** via webcam
